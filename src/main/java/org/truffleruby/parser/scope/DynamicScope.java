/**
 * Represents the the dynamic portion of scoping information.  The variableValues are the
 * values of assigned local or block variables.  The staticScope identifies which sort of
 * scope this is (block or local).
 * 
 * Properties of Dynamic Scopes:
 * 1. static and dynamic scopes have the same number of names to values
 * 2. size of variables (and thus names) is determined during parsing.  So those structured do
 *    not need to change
 *
 * FIXME: When creating dynamic scopes we sometimes accidentally pass in extra parents.  This
 * is harmless (other than wasting memory), but we should not do that.  We can fix this in two
 * ways:
 * 1. Fix all callers
 * 2. Check parent that is passed in and make if new instance is local, then its parent is not local
