# Installing LLVM

Since TruffleRuby 19.3.0, TruffleRuby ships with its own LLVM toolchain.
Therefore, it is no longer necessary to install LLVM. If you are using an older
version, see [the documentation for that version](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/vm-19.2.0/doc/user/installing-llvm.md).

## macOS

On macOS, make sure you have installed the command line developer tools from Xcode:

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```
